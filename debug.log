The Ab class went on to become the most numerous class of steam locomotive to run in New Zealand, totalling 151 locomotives by the late 1950s.  In 1925 Gordon Coates (the Minister of Railways) agreed to name a steam locomotive \'in memory of those members of the New Zealand Railways who fell in the Great War\'. Ab608 was the locomotive selected to carry the name, \'Passchendaele\'.  The locomotive was retired in October 1967 when its boiler required heavy repairs. By the time it was withdrawn from service, Ab608 had steamed more than 2.4 million kilometres. It was subsequently given to the New Zealand Railway and Locomotive Society (http://www.railsoc.org.nz) for preservation, arriving at Ferrymead in 1978. It is currently undergoing restoration by Steam Incorporated (http://www.steaminc.org.nz) at Paekakariki, north of Wellington.  This Limited Edition print (based on a pencil drawing) is personally signed and numbered by the artist and is printed on A3 size silk finish 180gsm paper suitable for framing. The paper is archival quality (said to last for 200 years).  Note: the A3 print is of a much higher quality - the accompanying image has been reduced to deter copying and does not do the art work justice.

The Ab class went on to become the most numerous class of steam locomotive to run in New Zealand, totalling 151 locomotives by the late 1950s.  In 1925 Gordon Coates (the Minister of Railways) agreed to name a steam locomotive \'in memory of those members of the New Zealand Railways who fell in the Great War\'. Ab608 was the locomotive selected to carry the name, \'Passchendaele\'.  The locomotive was retired in October 1967 when its boiler required heavy repairs. By the time it was withdrawn from service, Ab608 had steamed more than 2.4 million kilometres. It was subsequently given to the New Zealand Railway and Locomotive Society (http://www.railsoc.org.nz) for preservation, arriving at Ferrymead in 1978. It is currently undergoing restoration by Steam Incorporated (http://www.steaminc.org.nz) at Paekakariki, north of Wellington.  This Limited Edition print (based on a pencil drawing) is personally signed and numbered by the artist and is printed on A3 size silk finish 180gsm paper suitable for framing.

Pencil Sketch.  Its signed and dated 1925.  Frame under glass 480x350. Picture 300x150.  Robert Nettleton Field was born in Bromley, Kent, England, on 3 March 1899.   After winning various scholarships to art schools at Bromley and Southend-on-Sea between 1914 and 1919, Field was awarded a Royal Exhibition and entered the Royal College of Art in London in September 1914.     He decided to emigrate to New Zealand in 1925.   In August 1925 Field began teaching sculpture and drawing full time and by 1930 was also taking part-time groups for outdoor sketching, life drawing, painting and linocuts. Field\'s teaching style was very informal and disorganised. Yet his austere, dreamy manner, his whimsical sense of humour and bursts of passing interests and enthusiasms sparked the older students\' imaginations and his own work proved a great influence.    Between 1928 and 1932 Field painted portraits, landscapes and still lifes in pure, jewel-like colours which demonstrated how colour, as well as line, form, design and materials, could be enjoyed.    Field spent 1933–34 on leave with his wife in England.  Field returned to Dunedin in 1935  Field returned to painting and sculpting after his retirement in 1960 and continued after Marion died in 1983. Although no longer in the vanguard of modern art, he maintained a spirit of experimentation almost until his death in Auckland on 18 February 1987. Field\'s achievements as an artist were somewhat overlooked during the latter half of his life, partly because many of his best works remained in private collections. However, a resurgence of interest since the early 1980s has seen him generally recognised as a vital conveyor of modern European ideas on art and art education to New Zealand.

Wananga of Indigenous Art, hosted at Apumoana Marae Rotorua. First gathering of indigenous visual artists.   Rick Bartow  (b1946 in Newport, Oregon), Native American artist, affiliated with the Wiyot & Yurok tribes of Northern California. He works with sculpture, print, etching, ceramics, mixed media, and painting.  Rick Bartow attended Western Oregon University, graduating in 1969 with a degree in secondary art education. He then spent 13 months in Vietnam as a teletype operator & as a musician in a military hospital, for which he was awarded the Bronze Star.  His work can be found in several museum collections including the Eiteljorg Museum of American Indians & Western Arts in Indianapolis, IN, the National Museum of the American Indian in Washington, DC, the Hallie Ford Museum of Art in Salem, OR, the Heard Museum in Phoenix, AZ, the de Saisset Museum & the Portland Art Museum. In 2003 his works were exhibited at the George Gustav Heye Center, a branch of the National Museum of the American Indian in New York City.  His carving The Cedar Mill Pole was displayed in the Jacqueline Kennedy Garden at the White House in 1997; it had been designated one of the most highly-regarded Native American public sculptures in the country. The pole was partially inspired by Bartow\'s work with the Maori artist John Bevan Ford. Presented as a gift to the Portland, Oregon metropolitan community from Oregon\'s Washington County & the Oregon College of Art & Craft.   As influences, Bartow cites Marc Chagall, Francis Bacon, Odilon Redon, & Horst Janssen, in addition to his Native American heritage & his work with the Mori. These artists also worked expressionistically with human & animal forms.

During these years, Stephen was also working as an illustrator and having exhibitions of his own work. As a freelancer, he has also produced mounds of outstanding commissions for ad agencies, publishers and design shops. Steve has also poured his energies into community projects like murals for the city council and building and designing elaborate floats and costumes for the Wellington Batucada, a community samba band. He is also a member of the up-and-coming band The Beat Squad.   Never turning down a great project, Steve has also made stage sets, music videos and more recently animation. In 2007, children\'s musicians Fat Cat and Fish Face commissioned Stephen and his sister Ruth Templer to make a kid\'s music video called the The Wreck of the Diddley which featured in the 2007 International Film Festival. The film was very well received and it has since been shown in Melbourne and London. Ruth and Steve have since worked on other animation projects for Fat Cat and Fish Face (see the animation section).  **Please look through our other art auctions - enter Art4Vanuatu in the search field**\r\n    \r\n    \r\n        Please read the questions and answers for this auction.', '/art/drawings/auction-862304604.htm', 105.0, 'ART4VANUATU - Stephen Templer - original painting', 862304604, 'Drawings')

The Ab class went on to become the most numerous class of steam locomotive to run in New Zealand, totalling 151 locomotives by the late 1950s.  In 1925 Gordon Coates (the Minister of Railways) agreed to name a steam locomotive \'in memory of those members of the New Zealand Railways who fell in the Great War\'. Ab608 was the locomotive selected to carry the name, \'Passchendaele\'.  The locomotive was retired in October 1967 when its boiler required heavy repairs. By the time it was withdrawn from service, Ab608 had steamed more than 2.4 million kilometres. It was subsequently given to the New Zealand Railway and Locomotive Society (http://www.railsoc.org.nz) for preservation, arriving at Ferrymead in 1978. It is currently undergoing restoration by Steam Incorporated (http://www.steaminc.org.nz) at Paekakariki, north of Wellington.

Pencil Sketch.  Its signed and dated 1925.  Frame under glass 480x350. Picture 300x150.  Robert Nettleton Field was born in Bromley, Kent, England, on 3 March 1899.   After winning various scholarships to art schools at Bromley and Southend-on-Sea between 1914 and 1919, Field was awarded a Royal Exhibition and entered the Royal College of Art in London in September 1914.     He decided to emigrate to New Zealand in 1925.   In August 1925 Field began teaching sculpture and drawing full time and by 1930 was also taking part-time groups for outdoor sketching, life drawing, painting and linocuts. Field\'s teaching style was very informal and disorganised. Yet his austere, dreamy manner, his whimsical sense of humour and bursts of passing interests and enthusiasms sparked the older students\' imaginations and his own work proved a great influence.    Between 1928 and 1932 Field painted portraits, landscapes and still lifes in pure, jewel-like colours which demonstrated how colour, as well as line, form, design and materials, could be enjoyed.    Field spent 1933–34 on leave with his wife in England.  Field returned to Dunedin in 1935  Field returned to painting and sculpting after his retirement in 1960 and continued after Marion died in 1983. Although no longer in the vanguard of modern art, he maintained a spirit of experimentation almost until his death in Auckland on 18 February 1987. Field\'s achievements as an artist were somewhat overlooked during the latter half of his life, partly because many of his best works remained in private collections. However, a resurgence of interest since the early 1980s has seen him generally recognised as a vital conveyor of modern European ideas on art and art education to New Zealand.

Wananga of Indigenous Art, hosted at Apumoana Marae Rotorua. First gathering of indigenous visual artists.   Rick Bartow  (b1946 in Newport, Oregon), Native American artist, affiliated with the Wiyot & Yurok tribes of Northern California. He works with sculpture, print, etching, ceramics, mixed media, and painting.  Rick Bartow attended Western Oregon University, graduating in 1969 with a degree in secondary art education. He then spent 13 months in Vietnam as a teletype operator & as a musician in a military hospital, for which he was awarded the Bronze Star.  His work can be found in several museum collections including the Eiteljorg Museum of American Indians & Western Arts in Indianapolis, IN, the National Museum of the American Indian in Washington, DC, the Hallie Ford Museum of Art in Salem, OR, the Heard Museum in Phoenix, AZ, the de Saisset Museum & the Portland Art Museum. In 2003 his works were exhibited at the George Gustav Heye Center, a branch of the National Museum of the American Indian in New York City.  His carving The Cedar Mill Pole was displayed in the Jacqueline Kennedy Garden at the White House in 1997; it had been designated one of the most highly-regarded Native American public sculptures in the country. The pole was partially inspired by Bartow\'s work with the Maori artist John Bevan Ford. Presented as a gift to the Portland, Oregon metropolitan community from Oregon\'s Washington County & the Oregon College of Art & Craft.   As influences, Bartow cites Marc Chagall, Francis Bacon, Odilon Redon, & Horst Janssen, in addition to his Native American heritage & his work with the Mori. These artists also worked expressionistically with human & animal forms.

During these years, Stephen was also working as an illustrator and having exhibitions of his own work. As a freelancer, he has also produced mounds of outstanding commissions for ad agencies, publishers and design shops. Steve has also poured his energies into community projects like murals for the city council and building and designing elaborate floats and costumes for the Wellington Batucada, a community samba band. He is also a member of the up-and-coming band The Beat Squad.   Never turning down a great project, Steve has also made stage sets, music videos and more recently animation. In 2007, children\'s musicians Fat Cat and Fish Face commissioned Stephen and his sister Ruth Templer to make a kid\'s music video called the The Wreck of the Diddley which featured in the 2007 International Film Festival. The film was very well received and it has since been shown in Melbourne and London. Ruth and Steve have since worked on other animation projects for Fat Cat and Fish Face (see the animation section).  **Please look through our other art auctions - enter Art4Vanuatu in the search field**\r\n    \r\n    \r\n        Please read the questions and answers for this auction.', '/art/drawings/auction-862304604.htm', 105.0, 'ART4VANUATU - Stephen Templer - original painting', 862304604, 'Drawings')

The Ab class went on to become the most numerous class of steam locomotive to run in New Zealand, totalling 151 locomotives by the late 1950s.  In 1925 Gordon Coates (the Minister of Railways) agreed to name a steam locomotive \'in memory of those members of the New Zealand Railways who fell in the Great War\'. Ab608 was the locomotive selected to carry the name, \'Passchendaele\'.  The locomotive was retired in October 1967 when its boiler required heavy repairs. By the time it was withdrawn from service, Ab608 had steamed more than 2.4 million kilometres. It was subsequently given to the New Zealand Railway and Locomotive Society (http://www.railsoc.org.nz) for preservation, arriving at Ferrymead in 1978. It is currently undergoing restoration by Steam Incorporated (http://www.steaminc.org.nz) at Paekakariki, north of Wellington.

Pencil Sketch.  Its signed and dated 1925.  Frame under glass 480x350. Picture 300x150.  Robert Nettleton Field was born in Bromley, Kent, England, on 3 March 1899.   After winning various scholarships to art schools at Bromley and Southend-on-Sea between 1914 and 1919, Field was awarded a Royal Exhibition and entered the Royal College of Art in London in September 1914.     He decided to emigrate to New Zealand in 1925.   In August 1925 Field began teaching sculpture and drawing full time and by 1930 was also taking part-time groups for outdoor sketching, life drawing, painting and linocuts. Field\'s teaching style was very informal and disorganised. Yet his austere, dreamy manner, his whimsical sense of humour and bursts of passing interests and enthusiasms sparked the older students\' imaginations and his own work proved a great influence.    Between 1928 and 1932 Field painted portraits, landscapes and still lifes in pure, jewel-like colours which demonstrated how colour, as well as line, form, design and materials, could be enjoyed.    Field spent 1933–34 on leave with his wife in England.  Field returned to Dunedin in 1935  Field returned to painting and sculpting after his retirement in 1960 and continued after Marion died in 1983. Although no longer in the vanguard of modern art, he maintained a spirit of experimentation almost until his death in Auckland on 18 February 1987. Field\'s achievements as an artist were somewhat overlooked during the latter half of his life, partly because many of his best works remained in private collections. However, a resurgence of interest since the early 1980s has seen him generally recognised as a vital conveyor of modern European ideas on art and art education to New Zealand.

Wananga of Indigenous Art, hosted at Apumoana Marae Rotorua. First gathering of indigenous visual artists.   Rick Bartow  (b1946 in Newport, Oregon), Native American artist, affiliated with the Wiyot & Yurok tribes of Northern California. He works with sculpture, print, etching, ceramics, mixed media, and painting.  Rick Bartow attended Western Oregon University, graduating in 1969 with a degree in secondary art education. He then spent 13 months in Vietnam as a teletype operator & as a musician in a military hospital, for which he was awarded the Bronze Star.  His work can be found in several museum collections including the Eiteljorg Museum of American Indians & Western Arts in Indianapolis, IN, the National Museum of the American Indian in Washington, DC, the Hallie Ford Museum of Art in Salem, OR, the Heard Museum in Phoenix, AZ, the de Saisset Museum & the Portland Art Museum. In 2003 his works were exhibited at the George Gustav Heye Center, a branch of the National Museum of the American Indian in New York City.  His carving The Cedar Mill Pole was displayed in the Jacqueline Kennedy Garden at the White House in 1997; it had been designated one of the most highly-regarded Native American public sculptures in the country. The pole was partially inspired by Bartow\'s work with the Maori artist John Bevan Ford. Presented as a gift to the Portland, Oregon metropolitan community from Oregon\'s Washington County & the Oregon College of Art & Craft.

During these years, Stephen was also working as an illustrator and having exhibitions of his own work. As a freelancer, he has also produced mounds of outstanding commissions for ad agencies, publishers and design shops. Steve has also poured his energies into community projects like murals for the city council and building and designing elaborate floats and costumes for the Wellington Batucada, a community samba band. He is also a member of the up-and-coming band The Beat Squad.   Never turning down a great project, Steve has also made stage sets, music videos and more recently animation. In 2007, children\'s musicians Fat Cat and Fish Face commissioned Stephen and his sister Ruth Templer to make a kid\'s music video called the The Wreck of the Diddley which featured in the 2007 International Film Festival. The film was very well received and it has since been shown in Melbourne and London. Ruth and Steve have since worked on other animation projects for Fat Cat and Fish Face (see the animation section).  **Please look through our other art auctions - enter Art4Vanuatu in the search field**\r\n    \r\n    \r\n        Please read the questions and answers for this auction.', '/art/drawings/auction-862304604.htm', 'Home/Art', 0, 120.0, 'ART4VANUATU - Stephen Templer - original painting', 862304604)

He originally trained as a ballet dancer, performing first with the Royal New Zealand Ballet and later overseas principally with the Royal Opera Ballet Covent Garden.
